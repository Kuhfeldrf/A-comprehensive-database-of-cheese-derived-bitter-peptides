METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------

  1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
    a) Literature Search
    To build our database, we conducted a comprehensive literature search using Web of Science (www.webofscience.com) for primary journal articles that identify bitter peptides extracted from and identified in cheese, bitter peptides originating from enzymatic digestion of cheese or caseins and bitter peptides that were synthesized and we could match to the sequences of bovine milk proteins that could be in cheese (match parameters described below in this section). 
    This search included the key phrases “bitter peptides,” “bitterness in cheese,” “bitter threshold,” “bitter threshold value” and “bitter casein hydrolysis” and was not limited according to publication date. The search was performed between March 2021 and November 2022. We identified 49 references that met these criteria. 
    A large array of dipeptides and tripeptides have been synthesized and examined for bitterness without regard to protein of origin and are not specific to cheese. As many of these bitter dipeptides and tripeptides could be present in cheese, we searched for their sequence alignment with the major cheese-associated bovine milk proteins. For the tripeptides, we used the Peptide Match tool as described above. For tripeptides, we frequently identified multiple potential position alignments (shown in Tables 2, 3, 4 and 6). As the Peptide Match tool could not search for dipeptides, we searched for dipeptide positions manually against the milk protein sequence list. Sequence positions for dipeptides peptides are not shown in Table 6 because these peptides had many possible match sites. 
    This peptide query and the review of each peptide in the search process allowed the correction of inaccurately labeled peptides in the literature. The query tool allowed the rejection of peptides that did not align with milk proteins (e.g., QEPVLGPVREGPFP [Karametsi et al. 2014]) and correction of peptide sequences that were incorrectly labelled in past literature; for example, in the literature (Lemieux and Simard 1992), αs1-casein (30) and β-casein (195) are listed as glutamine (Q) though they are glutamic acid (E). Similarly, several numerical sequence position labels that were incorrect by one amino acid position were identified and corrected; for example, VRGPFP from β-casein was corrected to 201−206, IPPL from β-casein was corrected to 74−77 and VVPPFL from β-casein was corrected to 84−88 (Toelstede and Hofmann 2008a; Sebald et al. 2020). 
      Peptides QDKIHPFAQTQSLVYPFPGPIPNSLPQNIPPLTQTPVVV (β-casein [46−84]) and YLEQLLR (αs1-casein [94−100]) were reported as bitter in a review article (Lemieux and Simard 1992), in contradiction with the primary reference (Hamilton et al., 1974) and, therefore, were reported as non-bitter in the database. 
    b) Database
    The completed database includes 226 unique peptide sequences. For each peptide, the database provides the sequence position within the protein (excluding dipeptides), the physical properties (weight, length and hydrophobicity), bitterness sensory values, the source (cheese, enzymatic digest or synthetic) and literature references. The sequence positions of casein-originating peptides reported in this article do not include protein signal sequences. The database is provided in both text format and CSV format (Supplemental Materials). 
    The database is subdivided into the following five groups. Group I: Bitter peptides (length ≥ 3 AA) with only qualitative bitterness determination (Table 2). The lack of quantitative sensory data for this group prevented us from later analyzing correlation to a peptide’s physical properties. Group II: Bitter peptides (length ≥ 3 AA) with quantitative bitterness threshold values, which allowed analysis of correlation to the physical properties of peptides (Table 3). Group II is the focus of our later statistical analysis. Group III: Peptides (length ≥ 3 AA) with an undetermined bitterness threshold value or that are documented as non-bitter which prevented quantitative analysis (Table 4). Group IV: Dipeptides. Dipeptides are grouped separately because they cannot be mapped to their specific originating milk protein (Table 5). Group V: Peptides (length ≥ 3 AA) with documented bitterness threshold values that originate from whey proteins (Table 6).

2. Methods for processing the data: 
  c) Statistical Analysis 
  Data were entered into an Excel database, and descriptive and correlational analyses were conducted. Descriptive analysis involved computing the mean, standard deviation and range for all analysis variables. The correlation of the different physical properties of a peptide on bitterness threshold values was problematic across the entire data set due to extremely large bitterness threshold values for peptides with little or no bitterness or the absence of bitterness threshold values (groups I, III, IV and V). Seventy peptides with exact bitterness threshold values were selected for correlation analysis from group II.
  Analysis included correlations and linear regressions (type 1 error rate = 0.05). Correlations were conducted among the variables describing the following peptide properties: bitterness, molecular weight, length, hydrophobic terminals, number of prolines and hydrophobicity. The linear regressions included molecular weight and hydrophobic as the dependent and bitterness threshold value as the independent variable. Peptide length and number of prolines were not included as independent variables due to their high correlation with molecular weight (0.62 < r < 0.99).
  Heat maps showing the density of bitter peptides overlaid on the bovine casein sequence of origin for αs1-, αs2-, β- and κ-casein were generated. The number of overlapping bitter peptide sequences was summed and plotted above the αs1-, αs2-, β- and κ-casein sequences. A scatter plot was generated with bitterness threshold values on the y-axis and the peptide’s origin in the casein sequence on the x-axis, as performed previously (Nielsen 2017). Of the 70 peptides in group II (Table 3), 60 were plotted; tripeptides were excluded because of their larger bitterness threshold values (low bitterness) and multiple alignments within and to different casein proteins. Peptides in groups I and III without exact threshold values (y-axis), along with dipeptides (groups IV) and whey protein peptides (group V) without specific casein sequence alignment (x-axis), were not included in the heatmap because the required x, y coordinates were missing.
